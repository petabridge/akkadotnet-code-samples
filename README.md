# Akka.NET Professional Code Samples

[Akka.NET](http://getakka.net/ "Akka.NET - .NET distributed actor framework") is a radically different way of developing concurrent and networked applications in .NET, and so it's important to have a number of high quality reference applications developers can explore in order to better understand how to design and model software using Actors and Akka.NET.

That's the goal of this repository - to provide a small number of *exceptionally* well-explained and documented examples .NET architects and developers can use to better understand how to take advantage of Akka.NET's full potential.

## Current Samples

**[Doing Asynchronous Operations inside Actors with PipeTo](/PipeTo/)** - how to use `Task<T>` and `async` operations inside your actors using the `PipeTo` pattern in Akka.NET.

**[Testing actors with`Akka.TestKit`](/TestKit/)** â€” how to test your `ActorSystem`s, explanation of the core & advanced features of the testing framework, as well as addressing common testing FAQs and situations.

**[ASP.NET and Windows Service Microservices with Akka.Cluster](Cluster.WebCrawler)** - build an elastically scalable web-crawler using Akka.Cluster in Windows Services and ASP.NET MVC.

**[Remote Deployment of Actors with Akka.Remote](RemoteDeploy/)** - how to deploy actors over the network using the Akka.Remote module.

**[AtLeastOnceDelivery Actors and Guaranteed Message Delivery](AtLeastOnceDelivery/)** - how to use the `AtLeastOnceDeliveryActor` base class in Akka.Persistence to deliver messages multiple times until they're acknowledged by the recipient.

## Contributing

We accept pull requests for new samples or changes to existing ones, but we maintain a very high standard of quality.

Please see our [PipeTo Sample](/PipeTo/) for an example.

Any samples you want to submit must:

* Contain detailed comments in the source code;
* Have a detailed `README` explaining your architectural choices and data flows;
* Be markedly distinct from any other sample in this repository;
* Be concise enough that a single developer can review it easily.
